### I am started programmers (would like to believe it ðŸ˜„)

I am coding on java :coffee:.  Tried different languages â€” python, js, html, css. But on my view java is most simply programming language (joking of course).

I have a dog :dog:. Jack Russell Terrier â€” it is the same breed of dog like in the film Â«MaskÂ». And she is really high jump :relaxed:
